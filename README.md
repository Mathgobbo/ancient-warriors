## Ancient Warriors NFT

This is a monorepo with the Flow Smart Contracts and the frontend of this application.
Ancient Warriors is a NFT Collection of warriors from past times.

Built this to understand better the concepts with NFTs inside the Flow Blockchain, including their standards and Cadence contracts.
To run locally, you have to:

**1) Start the emulator**
  `flow emulator`

**2) Start the dev wallet**
  `flow dev-wallet`

**3) Deploy the Contracts**
  `flow deploy`
  
**4) Run the NextJs Frontend**

There are some transactions built and a script to test.
